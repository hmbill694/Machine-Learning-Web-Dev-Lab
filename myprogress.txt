Building the front end: 

step 0:

using the vue cli I created project using the command
" vue create _project-name_" from within my terminal. 
During the setup process I used vuex and vueRouter. I 
am also using eslint and babel. I will also be using 
vuetify for the material design components. To do this
I ran the command "vue add vuetify" from within the project
folder. Now I have vuetify.


step 1: 

After I removed all the boiler plate from the created project I 
started to work on the App bar which will be present throughtout 
the app. This app bar will contain the button which when pressed will
display a nav menu which will allow sitewide navigation. Each one of these
will be seperate components, with the appbar component containing the 
nav list. The appbar will then be placed in the app.vue file of the 
application. 

step 2: 

Next I set up the vue router. This will allow the app to be a single page 
application. I struggled with this a little as I did not fully understand 
how the routing worked. The resources I used to help me further understanding are 
https://router.vuejs.org/ and to help me implement vue router I used this
video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY2MiaYiSdw. I then implemented the router
by placing the "router-view" component into the app page. Next, using the "v-navigation-drawer",
which side bar is already preconfigured to work with Vue Router, set the ":to" property to each 
of my router links which exist in the NavList component data. 

step 3:
Okay, first bug/mistake. The "v-app-bar-nav-icon" found within my AppBar component needed to
be clicked twice to open. Why? Well, I was mishandling how I was passing to and emitting from
the AppBar compoennt. To review when passing a prop to a component it looks like :foo="bar" where
bar is either a member of data, a computed value, or is itself a prop. If you intend to modify
bar and send it back to the parent, it should look like @changeBar="change" where change is a 
function in the parent component and changeBar is a function within the child. Look here is
a poor illustration.

    ---------------
    |   parent    |
    ---------------
      |           ^
      |:foo="bar" | @changeBar="change"
      v           |
    ----------------
    |   child      |
    ----------------
